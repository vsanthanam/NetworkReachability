    @Intro(title: "Implementing Reachability") {
        This tutorial guides you through the process of consuming reachability data in your application.

            Use delegation to update your application's user interface when its network connectivity changes.
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Import `NetworkReachability` in `ViewController.swift` so you can begin using the library.
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: "ImportNetworkReachability.swift", previousFile: "PlaceholderViewDidLoad.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Add `NetworkMonitorDelegate` conformance to `ViewController`.
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: "Delegate.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Update the view controller's UI in the delegate callback.
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: "DelegateConformance.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Initialize an instance of `NetworkMonitor` in `viewDidLoad()` and assign its delegate.
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: "CreateMonitor.swift")
            }
            @Step {
                Run the app and try changing the targe device's network connectivity. Your UI should update to match.

                This works best on device, or when targeting Mac Catalyst, as the iPhone Simulator's reachability callbacks are spotty at best.
            }
        }
    }
}
